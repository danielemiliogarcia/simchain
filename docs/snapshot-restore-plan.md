# Chain snapshot/restore: design and implementation record

## Status: IMPLEMENTED (2026-07-10, verification plan §8 executed in full)

Implements the former nice-to-have **"Chain snapshot/restore (UTXO set
export/import)"** (removed from [NICE-TO-HAVE.md](NICE-TO-HAVE.md) on ship, per repo
convention). The user-facing rationale, and the argument for a datadir snapshot over
Core's native `dumptxoutset`/`loadtxoutset`, are preserved in the
[appendix](#appendix-rationale-from-the-original-nice-to-have-entry). The sections
below are the design as built: exact changes, file by file, plus the verification
plan that was run.

## 1. Goal and non-goals

**Goal:** two commands.

```bash
./scripts/snapshot.sh save mysnap      # running chain -> snapshots/mysnap.tar.gz
./scripts/snapshot.sh restore mysnap   # fresh simnet resuming at the saved height
```

A restored simnet boots with the bootstrap already done (chain past height 204, mature
miner wallets, funded user address, persisted mempool) and simply continues: the
mining controller resumes block production on top, the spammer resumes spamming, and
coins the user received on the saved chain are still spendable with their external
keys.

**Non-goals:**

- No cross-version migration. A snapshot is restored onto the same `BTC_IMAGE` it was
  taken from (bitcoind datadir upgrades are one-way across major versions). The script
  warns on mismatch; making it work is not attempted.
- No live/hot snapshot. The stack is stopped for the seconds the tar takes; leveldb
  (chainstate, indexes) is not safely copyable under a running bitcoind.
- No snapshotting of the optional tools' state. electrs keeps its DB in container-local
  `/tmp/electrs-db` and re-indexes from node1 on start; the mempool explorer's mariadb
  is likewise ephemeral and rebuilds. Explorer statistics history is lost on restore —
  accepted.

## 2. Current state (what the plan builds on)

- **No volumes anywhere.** `docker-compose.yml` declares zero volumes; all three node
  datadirs live inside the containers, so today `docker compose down` destroys the
  chain. Persisting the datadirs is the enabling change.
- **Datadir path is `/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin` in both images** — the official
  `bitcoin/bitcoin:31.1` and the locally built one (`docker/bitcoin-node.Dockerfile`
  sets `ENV BITCOIN_DATA=/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin`). The local image's entrypoint
  already `chown -R`s the datadir on every start, so restored file ownership
  self-heals.
- **Bootstrap is height-driven and resumable.** `crates/mining-controller/src/bootstrap.rs`
  ends at `BOOTSTRAP_END = 204` and skips every stage whose target height is already
  reached: on a restored chain it logs "Chain already bootstrapped" and goes straight
  to steady-state mining. `setup_wallet` (`crates/mining-controller/src/wallet.rs`)
  loads an existing wallet instead of creating one. **No Rust changes are needed.**
- **All persistent state lives in the node datadirs**: blocks, chainstate, `-txindex`
  data, the `node2`/`node3` wallets (used by both the controller and the spammer), and
  `mempool.dat` (written on clean shutdown, loaded on start). The controller and
  spammer containers are stateless by design (their compose comments say so).
- **Wallet names and the user address come from `.env`**
  (`NODE2_WALLET_NAME`/`NODE3_WALLET_NAME`, `USER_ADDRESS`): a snapshot is only
  meaningful under the same values, which is what the metadata check (§5) enforces.

## 3. Change 1 — persist node datadirs on named volumes

`docker-compose.yml`: add one volume per node, explicitly named (the project already
pins container and network names, and explicit names free the snapshot script from
depending on the compose project name):

```yaml
# in each node service
    volumes:
      - node1-data:/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin   # node2-data / node3-data respectively

# top level
volumes:
  node1-data:
    name: btc-simnet-node1-data
  node2-data:
    name: btc-simnet-node2-data
  node3-data:
    name: btc-simnet-node3-data
```

**This is a behavior change independent of snapshots** and must be documented (§7):
after `docker compose down && docker compose up` the chain now *persists* (bitcoind
reloads the datadir, the controller skips the bootstrap). A fresh chain now requires
`docker compose down -v`. This is a feature — it is exactly what makes restore
possible — but the README quick-start must say it. For the old "disposable chain"
workflow, `scripts/fresh-chain.sh` wraps `down -v` + `up -d` in one command; compose
itself has no flag for this (`up --renew-anon-volumes` only touches *anonymous*
volumes, and anonymous volumes would leak on every cycle and hide the datadirs from
the snapshot script).

Only the three node services get volumes. Controller, spammer and reorg stay
stateless; electrs and the mempool stack stay ephemeral on purpose (§1 non-goals).

## 4. Change 2 — `scripts/snapshot.sh`

New script, same conventions as `scripts/simulate-reorg.sh` (resolve `REPO_ROOT`, run
`docker compose -f "$REPO_ROOT/docker-compose.yml" --project-directory "$REPO_ROOT"`).
Reads `.env` for RPC credentials with the same defaults as the compose file
(`BTC_RPC_USER:-foo`, `BTC_RPC_PASS:-rpcpassword`).

```
Usage:
  snapshot.sh save <name>              stop stack, tar volumes, restart stack
  snapshot.sh restore <name> [--force] wipe volumes, untar, start stack
  snapshot.sh list                     show snapshots with height/date/image
```

`<name>` must match `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+`. Output is two files:
`snapshots/<name>.tar.gz` (the three datadirs under top-level `node1/`, `node2/`,
`node3/`) and `snapshots/<name>.json` (metadata, §5). Add `snapshots/` to
`.gitignore`.

### save

1. Refuse to overwrite an existing snapshot name.
2. While the stack is still up, collect metadata: height and best block hash via
   `docker exec btc-simnet-node1 bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=... getblockcount`
   / `getbestblockhash`, plus the resolved `BTC_IMAGE`, wallet names and
   `USER_ADDRESS` (defaults mirrored from the compose file). If the stack is not
   running, abort with a clear message — snapshotting a stopped stack is possible but
   the height/hash sanity data would be missing; keep v1 simple.
3. Record the currently *running* services (`docker compose ps --services --status
   running`): the resume step must `start` exactly these — starting the whole profile
   trips over containers that were never created (e.g. the mempool stack when only
   the basic profile is up; found in testing).
4. `docker compose stop` — the whole stack, not just the nodes: bitcoind gets SIGTERM
   and flushes chainstate, wallets and `mempool.dat`; stopping the controller/spammer
   with the nodes avoids their `restart: on-failure` crash-looping against dead RPC.
5. Tar the volumes from a scratch container (no dependencies beyond docker):

   ```bash
   docker run --rm \
     -v btc-simnet-node1-data:/snap/node1:ro \
     -v btc-simnet-node2-data:/snap/node2:ro \
     -v btc-simnet-node3-data:/snap/node3:ro \
     -v "$REPO_ROOT/snapshots:/out" \
     alpine tar czf "/out/<name>.tar.gz" --numeric-owner -C /snap node1 node2 node3
   ```

6. Write `snapshots/<name>.json`, then `docker compose start <running services>` to
   resume exactly what was running before.

### restore

1. Require both snapshot files; read the metadata.
2. Validate against the current environment (§5). On mismatch print what differs and
   abort; `--force` proceeds anyway.
3. `docker compose down --remove-orphans` (volumes survive `down` without `-v`), then
   `docker volume rm` the three volumes (ignore not-found).
4. `docker compose create`: compose recreates the volumes (with its own labels, so no
   "created outside of compose" warnings later) and the containers, but starts
   nothing — the datadirs are still empty at this point.
5. Untar from a scratch container (same mounts as save, `rw`, `tar xzf ... -C /snap
   --numeric-owner`).
6. `docker compose up -d <saved services>`: the metadata records which services were
   running at save time, and naming them explicitly makes compose activate their
   profiles automatically — the snapshot's shape (tools included) comes back with no
   flags. Extra args the user passed after the name override the recorded shape and
   are inserted as compose *global* flags (before the subcommand, also on the
   `create` above), so `snapshot.sh restore mysnap --profile all-tools` works;
   snapshots without the field fall back to the default services.
7. Post-check: wait for node1 healthy, then assert `getblockcount >=` the metadata
   height (the controller may already be mining on top — growth is success, shrinkage
   is a failed restore) and that `getblockhash <meta-height>` equals the metadata best
   hash. Print the resumed height.

### list

For each `snapshots/*.json`: name, creation date, height, image. Plain columns.

## 5. Metadata and restore validation

`snapshots/<name>.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "mysnap",
  "created": "2026-07-10T15:04:05-03:00",
  "height": 412,
  "best_block_hash": "3ba3...",
  "btc_image": "bitcoin/bitcoin:31.1",
  "node2_wallet": "node2",
  "node3_wallet": "node3",
  "user_address": "bcrt1qtmjqjf4t0mcts4jw9hvm54nl2rhjyeclntf3rr",
  "services": "btc-simnet-mining-controller btc-simnet-node1 ... mempool-web electrs"
}
```

`services` is the running-services list captured at save time (§4 save step 3),
reused by restore to bring the stack back in the same shape.

Checks on restore, in decreasing severity:

- **`btc_image` differs** → abort (datadir format may not round-trip; upgrades are
  one-way). `--force` overrides for e.g. a rebuilt local image with the same bitcoind
  version.
- **Wallet names differ** → abort. The controller/spammer would create *new* empty
  wallets and mine/spam from zero balance next to the funded ones.
- **`user_address` differs** → loud warning (not abort): the chain's user funding
  (bootstrap blocks 3–4 and anything sent since) pays the *old* address. This is the
  core use case — the whole point of restoring is that the user's address set did not
  change — so the script must make an accidental mismatch impossible to miss.

## 6. What needs no changes (verify, don't build)

- **Mining controller**: `bootstrap.rs:53` skips the funding sequence when
  `height >= BOOTSTRAP_END`; `wallet.rs` loads existing wallets. Resumes rotation
  mining directly.
- **Spammer**: stateless between cycles; funds itself from the restored miner wallets
  and rebuilds its fan-out from on-chain/mempool state exactly as it does after a
  container restart today.
- **Reorg simulator**: one-shot, reads live chain state; indifferent to how the chain
  got there.
- **electrs / mempool explorer**: no volumes; re-index from node1 on start. First
  start after a restore takes a few seconds of `--jsonrpc-import` catch-up.
- **mempool.dat**: restored transactions re-enter the mempool on start. Note:
  bitcoind expires mempool txs older than 336 hours; a very old snapshot restores
  with an empty mempool — harmless, the spammer refills it.

## 7. Documentation updates (done in the same change)

- **README**: "How to run" tear-down notes now cover `down` (chain persists) vs
  `down -v` (fresh chain); new "Chain snapshots" section; troubleshooting reset
  recipe updated; this document linked from the Documents list.
- **docs/RUNBOOK.md**: snapshots recipe added.
- **docs/SNAPSHOTS.md**: cookbook with concrete calls for the common situations.
- **docs/NICE-TO-HAVE.md**: feature #5 removed on ship (repo convention: shipped
  items are removed, not marked done); its rationale preserved in the appendix here.
- **`.gitignore`**: `snapshots/` added.

## 8. Verification plan (manual, in order — executed 2026-07-10, all green)

1. Fresh start with the volume change, no snapshot involved: `docker compose up`,
   bootstrap completes to 204+, spam flows. Then `docker compose down && up`: chain
   resumes (no re-bootstrap, controller logs "Chain already bootstrapped"), height
   continues. `down -v && up`: fresh chain, full bootstrap runs. This validates §3
   alone.
2. `save`: on a running chain past bootstrap, send coins to a user-controlled address,
   note height H and the user UTXOs (`scantxoutset`). Run
   `./scripts/snapshot.sh save t1` — stack stops, tar + json appear, stack resumes and
   keeps mining.
3. `restore` onto a wiped world: `docker compose down -v`, then
   `./scripts/snapshot.sh restore t1`. Assert: node1 healthy; height ≥ H and
   `getblockhash H` matches metadata; `scantxoutset` still shows the user UTXOs;
   controller mines on top within one block interval; spammer resumes (mempool
   refills); no wallet-creation errors in controller/spammer logs.
4. Tools after restore: `restore t1 --profile mempool` — electrs re-indexes, explorer
   shows the restored chain.
5. Guard rails: `restore` with a changed `NODE2_WALLET_NAME` in `.env` aborts;
   `--force` proceeds; changed `USER_ADDRESS` prints the loud warning; `save` refuses
   a duplicate name; `restore` of a missing name fails cleanly.
6. Reorg on a restored chain: `./scripts/simulate-reorg.sh 3` behaves normally.

## 9. Risks and edge cases

- **In-flight writes at stop time**: `docker compose stop` default grace is 10 s;
  bitcoind normally flushes well within it, but set `stop_grace_period: 60s` on the
  node services in the same PR so a slow flush (large mempool) is never killed
  mid-write.
- **Ownership across images**: official image and local image may use different UIDs
  for the `bitcoin` user. `--numeric-owner` preserves whatever the snapshot had, and
  the local entrypoint re-chowns on start; the official image handles its own
  permissions. If a restore onto the *other* image is ever forced, ownership is the
  first thing to check.
- **Disk growth**: with volumes, chain data now accumulates on the host across
  restarts (DATA-mode spam writes ~full blocks). `down -v` is the reset;
  `snapshot.sh list` plus `du -sh snapshots/` keep it visible. Not mitigated further
  in v1.
- **Compose `start` vs profiles**: after `save`, `docker compose start` only restarts
  containers that already existed, so whatever profile set was running resumes
  unchanged — no profile bookkeeping needed in the script.
